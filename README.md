# BrainInvaders
A project made during the Games4SocialImpact hackathon, with a group of four. Our job was to create a game which could be used to have a positive social impact. Our project is based on the 1978 classic game, Brain Invaders; however, with a therapeutic twist. Rather than destroying aliens, the player must destroy evil thoughts that come towards them. Our project was touted as extremely creative and smart. Link to project page: https://cjw102.itch.io/brain-invaders.
